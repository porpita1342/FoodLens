DIETARY TRACK APPLICATION SOFTWARE:

I want to build an application that gives people dietary suggestions when given a set of personal statistics such as weight, race, gender,(sensitive data, best excluded) heightâ€¦. 

It will include a calorie tracker. When you give it an image of a dish, it will automatically work out the ingredients in the food. 

Based on its ingredients, we can work out its nutritional values and determine whether it is suitable for the user or not.

Platform: mobile - IOS
(PC side not considered because its not convenient for the photo-taking feature)

Aim: output? Loss function?

Structure: 1. front end: UI - prototype: write on paper, Balsamiq. 
Coding: Xcode: database, IOS development communicate(AI API)

2. Back end: server - private/public
Database: add, delete, query, edit (Feature)
Algorithm: API, modeling (dynamic? Training data? classification, nutritional plan(generative model)?), API + modeling, Transformer, CNN + LSTM
Interact: private photo: cable

Test:
Error
Accuracy - rubric
Optimisation

Steps:

Software installation
UI design and development - user input
Algorithm
Integrate
Test and optimise

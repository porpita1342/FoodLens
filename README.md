## Overview

FoodLens allows users to capture photos of food and receive detailed nutritional analysis. The application leverages advanced segmentation models (YOLOv11-seg) and depth estimation to analyze food composition and provide accurate nutritional information.

The project aims to solve the challenge of accurately identifying multiple food items in a single image, segmenting them, and estimating their volume to calculate nutritional content.

## ‚ú® Features

- ‚úÖ **Instance segmentation** using YOLOv11-seg trained on FoodSeg103 dataset
- ‚úÖ **Multi-food detection** - identify and segment multiple food items simultaneously
- ‚úÖ **Real-time inference** - ~7.8ms per image on T4 GPU with TensorRT
- ‚úÖ **High accuracy** - trained on high-quality manually labeled dataset with 103 food classes
- üöß **Volume estimation** - currently exploring non-AI approaches
- üöß **RGBD image processing pipeline** - integration with iPhone depth cameras
- üöß **Mobile application UI** - Must be swift to access the hardwares

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The application uses a **client-server architecture** for optimal performance:

- **Client (Mobile App)**: 
  - Captures RGBD images using iPhone depth camera capabilities
  - Sends HEIC files with embedded depth data to server
  - Displays nutritional analysis results
  
- **Server (Remote GPU Infrastructure)**:
  - Receives and processes RGBD images
  - Performs instance segmentation using YOLOv11-seg
  - Classifies food items
  - Estimates volume and calculates nutritional content
  - Returns structured JSON response with results

**Why remote processing?** Mobile processors lack sufficient computational power for real-time segmentation, classification, and 3D reconstruction. Server-side processing ensures consistent performance and allows for more complex models.

## üöß Current Challenges

### Challenge 1: Volume Estimation [MAJOR]

**Problem:** Need an accurate method for volume estimation that doesn't rely purely on AI/ML approaches.

**Current Status:** Exploring geometric and depth-based estimation methods. Initially experimented with full 3D reconstruction but found it too resource-intensive.

**Attempted Solutions:**
- ‚ùå **Colmap** - Extremely slow, takes too much GPU time and resources
- ‚ùå **Open3D** - Similar performance issues
- üîÑ Currently researching depth-based volume estimation using single RGBD images

### Challenge 2: Segmentation Performance [MAJOR - RESOLVED]

**Problem:** Achieving fast, accurate food segmentation for real-time inference.

**Solutions Attempted:**
1. ‚ùå **Meta's Segment Anything Model (SAM)** 
   - Issue: Inference time way too long for mobile application
   - Not suitable for real-time use case

2. ‚ùå **FoodSAM** (GitHub: jamesjg/FoodSAM)
   - Issue: Unmaintained repository (last updated 2+ years ago)
   - Could not get it running properly due to environment/dependency issues

3. ‚ùå **YOLOv11n-seg + FoodInsSeg dataset**
   - Issue: Poor results due to low-quality dataset labels (likely machine-labeled)
   - Many food items not properly segmented

4. ‚úÖ **YOLOv11l-seg + FoodSeg103 dataset** [CURRENT SOLUTION]
   - High-quality manually labeled dataset
   - Excellent segmentation results
   - Acceptable inference time (~7.8ms on T4 with TensorRT)
   - Successfully trained and deployed

### Challenge 3: Cross-Dataset Name Matching [MAJOR]

**Problem:** Nutritional datasets from different sources use inconsistent naming conventions for the same food items.

**Example Issues:**
- Same food may have completely different names across datasets
- Different formatting (e.g., "fried chicken" vs "chicken_fried" vs "FriedChicken")
- Semantic differences not captured by string matching

**Attempted Solutions:**
- ‚ùå **FuzzyWuzzy library** - Only handles string literal similarities, misses semantic meaning
- üîÑ Exploring NLP-based semantic matching approaches
- üîÑ Considering creation of unified food ontology/mapping table

## ü§î Technical Decisions

### Why Remote Processing?

**Decision:** Perform all heavy computation on remote GPU servers rather than on-device.

**Reasons:**
- Segmentation models require significant computational resources
- Real-time inference not feasible on mobile CPUs
- Multi-class classification adds computational overhead
- 3D reconstruction (if implemented) extremely resource-intensive
- Apple's ML framework insufficient for these workloads

**Tradeoffs:**
- ‚úÖ Consistent performance across devices
- ‚úÖ Can use larger, more accurate models
- ‚úÖ Easy to update/improve models without app updates
- ‚ùå Requires internet connection
- ‚ùå Server costs
- ‚ùå Potential latency issues

### Where and How to Extract Depth Data?

**Decision:** Extract depth data server-side from HEIC files.

**Reasons:**
- Need color images for classification/segmentation anyway
- HEIC format efficiently stores depth + color data
- Reduces client-side processing complexity
- Server has more resources for depth extraction

**Implementation:** Send HEIC files directly to server. See [Apple's documentation on capturing photos with depth](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/capturing-photos-with-depth) for technical details.

### Development Environment Setup

**Problem:** Initially attempted dual-boot Ubuntu setup, but encountered persistent SSH issues.

**Solution:** 
- Switched to **Windows WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)**
- Use **Docker containers** for each developmental stage
- Separate containers for different model experiments
- Git for version control with GitHub integration

**Benefits:**
- Clean isolation between experiments
- Easy reproducibility
- No more dual-boot complications
- Integrated with VS Code for seamless development

### Server Infrastructure

**Initial Consideration:** Self-hosted containerized server on personal PC.

**Actual Solution:** **Railway.app** for deployment

**Why Railway:**
- 30-day free trial for initial development
- Extremely easy deployment - just connect GitHub repo
- Automatic deployment on git push
- Provides public URL for API access
- Auto-rebuilds on repository updates
- No complex server configuration needed

**Note:** The VPS doesn't need powerful specs - it primarily serves as an API endpoint. Actual ML inference happens on rented GPU servers (Vast AI with 3090/3090Ti GPUs).
